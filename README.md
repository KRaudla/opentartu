# Open Tartu (for Smart Citizens)

Tartu is presenting itself as a Smart City, but unfortunately not very Open City. There is no Open Data directory in Tartu, however some of the data can be scraped. Document registry provides data about the meetings, protocols, drafts for municipal acts and votes about them in commissions, government and council etc. They are provided with some metadata of varying quality, but with some effort it can be rendered quite usable.

We can make a case for Open Tartu with:

1. Converting the scraped documents to one of the standard formats used to present documents produced in decision processes and link them to roles and phases of decision process, highlight the amounts of money and political parties involved etc;

2. Displaying parts of process visually in order to avoid headache from reading too much bureaucratic gibberish and make it easy to grasp what's going on in city, use different criteria for displaying the information, different levels of zoom etc;

3. Showcase an e-democracy portal to comment on the documents in different phases and give citizens ability to vote on the same topics city government, commissions and council does vote on.

This is something that the city could do and even has admitted, that should be done, but won't do if not given an example of how this kind of Open Tartu would look like.

This is our opportunity to digivolve **Smart City of Tartu** to **Smart and Open City of Tartu** and make it the flagship of Open Governance and e-Democracy in Estonia (not to mention that if this actually works, this will be international news).
